North Western Melbourne Primary Health Network (NWMPHN) acknowledges the peoples of the
Kulin nation as the Traditional Custodians of the land on which our work in the community takes
place. We pay our respects to their Elders past and present.

We also recognise, respect and affirm the central role played in our work by people with lived
experience, their families and/or carers.

NWMPHN gratefully acknowledges the contribution of the Community Council, Clinical Council,
Expert Advisory Groups, community members and primary health care professionals, who
participated in the numerous engagement sessions to inform the development of the Health Needs
Assessment (HNA). Similarly, the contribution of the Melbourne Primary Care Network (MPCN)
Board and staff is also acknowledged, for their respective contributions to this important work.
